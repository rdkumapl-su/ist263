    <body>
        Hi, my name is Rosanne Kumapley. I was born in Chicago but was raised in Accra, Ghana till I came to Syracuse for university. I am majoring in Information Management and Technology with a concentration in data analytics because I like analyzing data. I am also doing a minor in finance. I have beginner - intermediate skills in Python, R, Javascript and SQL. I think I am also pretty decent with excel.
        Outside of school, my i favourite things to do and work are hanging out with my friends and also watching movies and TV; I am currently watching Prison break on Netflix.
