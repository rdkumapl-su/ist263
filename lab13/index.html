        Hi, my name is Rosanne Kumapley. I was born in Chicago but was raised in Accra, Ghana till I came to Syracuse for university. I am majoring in <strong> Information Management and Technology</strong> with a concentration in data analytics because I like analyzing data. I am also doing a minor in finance. 
        I have beginner - intermediate skills in Python, R, Javascript and SQL. I think I am also pretty decent with excel.
